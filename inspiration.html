      <p>The world is made of natural beauty. Some of it can be seen by walking out in a forest, or looking at a photograph taken from space. Yet much of the world’s beauty is somewhat intangible and difficult to fully grasp and appreciate. Gravity, dark matter, chaos and many other forces and laws that make the universe what it is remain unrealized by the common person. The modern artist is generally confronted with the choice of either creating a work that is completely self-contained and evokes a certain beauty or aesthetic, or displaying a scene that uses representation of that which can be seen visually represented in the world.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Representative artists look at the world in front of them, apply a filter, and then show it to the world. But why should a barrier be constructed for an artist who wishes to utilize an invisible source of beauty, just as he would use an idyllic landscape? Just as the naturalist painter interprets what is present in the natural world to create a work of art, so to can an artist interpret an invisible phenomena. Taking what can be known of those phenomena, such as data, the artist can apply a certain filter to create a work whose beauty or power comes simultaneously from the natural world and the artist’s mind. Rather than simply creating something beautiful, the artist is exposing beauty that surrounds us every day, but goes unexplored and unappreciated by most.</p>
